### **Project Name:** How to Be a Human

### **Project Description:**

For this video project, we've created a website hosting a short video titled "How to Be a Human." The video consists of three parts in which the narrator walks us through how to be a human in three steps. The first step discusses "how to breathe," the second part shows "how to walk," and the last part narrates "how to laugh." Our aim was to depict the most common human daily activities, actions performed every day without conscious intentions. While the narrator instructs on being human, an alien attempts to mimic these actions throughout the tutorial. Our video project not only presents a fun portrayal of human daily activities but also raises an ethical question about the essence of humanity. On the website, our aim was to create an engaging experience for users to contemplate what it truly means to be human and to assess their human skills.

### **Process:**

**Script & Filming:**

Our goal was to create a fun and cinematic video, drawing inspiration from Wes Anderson's well-crafted yet whimsical movies. We had a narrator guiding an alien through the three parts, with the alien attempting to replicate the instructions. To enhance the video's entertainment and cohesive value, we added ghost roles to assist the alien's learning process. Since we didn't recruit any actors/actresses, each group member took turns playing different roles, with others managing the camera and sound during shooting.

The most time-consuming part of this project was the preparation before shooting. Initially, we drafted a general script and then refined it to include specifics on where and how to shoot each scene. Opting for a fun and whimsical approach, we chose to film at the Arts Center's filming studio. Some scenes required human dynamics and crowds, so we filmed them outside the studio. However, the biggest challenge during shooting was filming in public spaces. In part 2, we needed crowded locations where people walked past as the alien imitated their movements. However, people often moved away from our filming area, making it difficult to get the exact shots we wanted.

**Editing process:**

QM took charge of the editing part of the project.

**Website Implementation:**

Buka developed the basic wireframe for the website, and Jason handled its implementation. We chose yellow, white, and black colors to match the whimsical and fun vibe of the video. Additionally, we included a test section to enhance user engagement.

**Quiz:**

Kyrie was responsible for the quiz part. Creating a quiz template was relatively simple, but developing a system to check submitted answers was a challenge. Initially, a direct comparison between the user's chosen answers and the correct ones was the method used. This approach did work; however, Kyrie decided to take a different approach due to the unnecessarily long code. He assigned values (from a to e) to each multiple choice after conducting some research. Once values were assigned, an array for the correct answers was created. The system then compared the selected choices to the answers, incrementing the score for each correct match.

### **Reflection/Evaluation:**

Reflecting on our project, "How to Be a Human," our primary goal was to create a video that was both entertaining and coherent. We're very content with how our project turned out. The video seamlessly blends humor and storytelling, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience. While the video offers a playful take on everyday human activities, the quiz component invites users to reflect more deeply on what it means to be human. It's this combination that allows users to engage in a fun exploration of humanity while also prompting introspection about the essence of being human. The journey from concept to execution was a collaborative effort that paid off. As a team, we strived for this balance, working diligently to infuse each scene with both laughter and coherence. It wasn't always easy, but seeing the final result makes the effort worthwhile. Some videos werenâ€™t on point as we were new to working with the camera, but the editing and the cuts really made the raw video so much better than the original version. And our quiz does pretty well on prompting users to reflect on humanity, too.
