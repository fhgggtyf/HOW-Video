### **Project Name:** How to Be a Human

### **Project Description:**

For this video project, we've created a website hosting a short video titled "How to Be a Human." The video consists of three parts in which the narrator walks us through how to be a human in three steps. The first step discusses "how to breathe," the second part shows "how to walk," and the last part narrates "how to laugh." Our aim was to depict the most common human daily activities, actions performed every day without conscious intentions. While the narrator instructs on being human, an alien attempts to mimic these actions throughout the tutorial. Our video project not only presents a fun portrayal of human daily activities but also raises an ethical question about the essence of humanity. On the website, our aim was to create an engaging experience for users to contemplate what it truly means to be human and to assess their human skills.

### **Process:**

**Script & Filming:**

Our goal was to create a fun and cinematic video, drawing inspiration from Wes Anderson's well-crafted yet whimsical movies. We had a narrator guiding an alien through the three parts, with the alien attempting to replicate the instructions. To enhance the video's entertainment and cohesive value, we added ghost roles to assist the alien's learning process. Since we didn't recruit any actors/actresses, each group member took turns playing different roles, with others managing the camera and sound during shooting.

The most time-consuming part of this project was the preparation before shooting. Initially, we drafted a general script and then refined it to include specifics on where and how to shoot each scene. Opting for a fun and whimsical approach, we chose to film at the Arts Center's filming studio. Some scenes required human dynamics and crowds, so we filmed them outside the studio. However, the biggest challenge during shooting was filming in public spaces. In part 2, we needed crowded locations where people walked past as the alien imitated their movements. However, people often moved away from our filming area, making it difficult to get the exact shots we wanted.

**Editing process:**

QM took charge of the editing part of the project.

Editing our short film was not just a task, but an exhilarating journey into the world of storytelling and visual artistry. Leveraging the robust capabilities of Da Vinci Resolve Studio 18.5, we transformed our raw footage into a cinematic experience that blends reality with a touch of fantasy. Our editing process was meticulously designed to elicit specific emotions, aiming to transport our audience into a dreamlike, almost surreal realm. The vivid color grading, characterized by high contrast and saturation, immediately draws viewers into this otherworldly ambiance, setting the tone for the entire film.

Our narrative approach was multifaceted, combining the unique perspectives of a narrator and the actors. In keeping with the film's quirky essence, we made bold choices, such as deliberately including the camera and recording equipment within the frame, adding a meta-cinematic layer to the storytelling. Recognizing the power of sound in film, we paid particular attention to audio quality. Poor audio can detract from even the most visually stunning film, but we turned this challenge into an opportunity to enhance the film's quirky character. This included the creative use of graphic overlays, like animated lungs during breathing scenes, which added a whimsical yet poignant touch.

Audio wasn't just a backdrop; it was a character in itself. We meticulously selected and layered sound effects, ranging from the subtle ambiance of birds chirping to a dynamic, quirky background score that mirrored the film's overall tone. This auditory landscape was not just heard but felt, enveloping the viewer in the film's unique universe.

Our visual storytelling was punctuated with intentional, awkward zooms on characters' faces, creating a sense of intimacy while maintaining the film's whimsical tone. A standout moment was the scene where the alien encounters his reflection, with the narrator subtly present in the background. This scene, meticulously composed according to the rule of thirds, symbolizes the film's careful balance of whimsy and thoughtful composition.

One of our greatest technical challenges was ensuring seamless audio-video synchronization and crafting transitions that felt natural and unobtrusive. The goal was to create a smooth, cohesive narrative flow that felt effortlessly guided by an unseen hand, maintaining the illusion of a world that was both bizarre and utterly believable. In achieving this, we not only showcased our technical skills but also our commitment to storytelling that engages, surprises, and delights.

**Website Implementation:**

Buka developed the basic wireframe for the website, and Jason handled its implementation. Transparent backgrounds and text shadows are employed to enhance the visual appeal of the website. Shadows, such as the text shadow in the first section, add depth to the design. We included a test section to enhance user engagement. The website follows a single-page application approach, where content is dynamically loaded on a single HTML page rather than navigating between multiple pages. This is achieved through JavaScript and CSS transitions and it makes the alien student unable to cheat and review the video after entering the test area! another thing is the use of CSS transitions enhances the user experience by providing smooth animations when transitioning between sections. The transform property is transitioned to create a sliding effect. The website embeds a YouTube video using an <iframe>. The video is placed within a container to maintain its aspect ratio. We chose yellow, white, and black colors to match the whimsical and fun vibe of the video. It also fits in with the yellowish hue of the video.

**Quiz:**

Kyrie was responsible for the quiz part. Creating a quiz template was relatively simple, but developing a system to check submitted answers was a challenge. Initially, a direct comparison between the user's chosen answers and the correct ones was the method used. This approach did work; however, Kyrie decided to take a different approach due to the unnecessarily long code. He assigned values (from a to e) to each multiple choice after conducting some research. Once values were assigned, an array for the correct answers was created. The system then compared the selected choices to the answers, incrementing the score for each correct match.

### **Reflection/Evaluation:**

Reflecting on our project, "How to Be a Human," our primary goal was to create a video that was both entertaining and coherent. We're very content with how our project turned out. The video seamlessly blends humor and storytelling, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience. While the video offers a playful take on everyday human activities, the quiz component invites users to reflect more deeply on what it means to be human. It's this combination that allows users to engage in a fun exploration of humanity while also prompting introspection about the essence of being human. The journey from concept to execution was a collaborative effort that paid off. As a team, we strived for this balance, working diligently to infuse each scene with both laughter and coherence. It wasn't always easy, but seeing the final result makes the effort worthwhile. Some videos weren’t on point as we were new to working with the camera, but the editing and the cuts really made the raw video so much better than the original version. And our quiz does pretty well on prompting users to reflect on humanity, too.
