### **Project Name:** How to be a Human

### **Project Description:**

For this video project, we've created a website that hosts a short video piece titled "How to be a Human". The video consists of three parts in which the narrator walk us through how to be a human in three steps. The first step discusses "how to breathe", the second part shows "how to walk", and the last part narrates "how to laugh". We aim to depict the most common human daily activities, actions we perform every day without conscious intentions. While the narrator instructs on being human, an alien attempts to mimic these actions throughout the tutorial. Our video project not only presents a fun portrayal of human daily activities but also raises an ethical question about the essence of humanity. On the website, we sought to create an engaging experience for users to contemplate what it truly means to be human and to assess their human skills.

### **Process:**

****************Script & Filming:****************

Our goal was to create a fun and cinematic video, drawing inspiration from Wes Anderson's well crafted yet whimsical type of movies. We had a narrator guiding an alien through the three parts, with the alien attempting to replicate the instructions. To enhance the video's entertainment / cohesive value, we added some ghost roles to assist the alien's learning process. As we didn't recruit any actors/actresses, each of group members took turns playing different roles, with others managing the camera and sound during shooting.

The lengthiest part of this project was the preparation before shooting. Initially, we drafted a general script and then refined it to include specifics on where and how to shoot each scene. Aiming for a fun and whimsical approach, we chose to do our shooting at the filming studio in Arts Center. Some scenes required human dynamics and crowds, so we filmed them outside the studio. However, the most challenge part during shooting was filming in public spaces. In part 2, we needed crowded locations where people walked past as the alien imitated their movements. However, people often moved away from our filming area, making it difficult to get the exact shots we wanted.

**Editing process:**

QM worked on the editing part of the project. 

********************************Website Implementation:********************************

Regarding the website creation, we first developed a basic wireframe (Buka was responsible for this part). We chose yellow, white, and black colors to match the whimsical and fun vibe of the video. 

The implementation of the website was done by Jason.

We also included a test section to enhance user engagement. 

**********Quiz:**********

Kyrie was responsible for the quiz part. Creating a quiz template was relatively simple, but developing a system to check submitted answers was a challenge. Initially, a direct comparison between the user's chosen answers and the correct ones was the method used. This approach did work, however, the code was unnecessarily long so he decided to take a different approach. Kyrie came up with the idea of putting values to each multiple choice. He did some research on how to put values in each choices. Once values (from a to e) were assigned to each option, an array for the correct answers were created. The system then compared the selected choices to the answers, incrementing the score for each correct match.

### **Reflection/Evaluation:**

Reflecting on our project, "How to be a Human," our primary goal was to create a video that was both entertaining and coherent. We're very content with how our project turned out to be. The video seamlessly blends humor and storytelling, ensuring a smooth experience that's both engaging and humorous. While the video offers a playful take on everyday human activities, the quiz component invites users to reflect more deeply on what it means to be human. And our quiz does pretty well on that, as well.

The journey from concept to execution was a collaborative effort that paid off. As a team, we strived for this balance, working diligently to infuse each scene with both laughter and coherence. It wasn't always easy, but seeing the final result makes the effort worthwhile.
